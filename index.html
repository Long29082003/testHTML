            <h1>What is Python</h1>
            <p class = "no-heading">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
            <p>It is used for:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side),</li>
            <li>software development,</li>
            <li>mathematics,</li>
            <li>system scripting.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Install">
            <h1>Python Install</h1>
            <p class = "no-heading">Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
            <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
            <code class = "terminal">C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
            <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:</p>
            <code class = "terminal">python --version</code>
            <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: <a href = "https://www.python.org/" target = "_blank">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Syntax">
            <h1>Python Syntax</h1>
            <h2>Execute Python Syntax</h2>
            <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
            <code class = "terminal">>>>print("Hello World")<br>Hello World</code>
            <h2>Python Indentation</h2>
            <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
            <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
            <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. </p>
            <code class = "example">if 5 > 2:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Variable">
            <h1>Python Variable</h1>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
            <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
            <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
            <code class = "example">x = 5<br>y = "John"<br>print(x)<br>print(y)</code>
            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
            <code class = "example">x = 4 <span class = "comment"># x is of type int</span><br>x = "Sally" <span class = "comment"># x is not of type str</span><br>print(x)</code>
            <h2>Case Sensitive</h2>
            <code class = "example">a = 4<br>A = "Sally"<span class = "comment"> # A will not overwrite a</span></code>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Data_Types">
            <h1>Python Data Types</h1>
            <h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
            <p>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
            <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
            <div class = "container1">
                <p><span class = "type">Text Type: </span><span class = "text">str</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Numeric Types: </span><span class = "text">int, float, complex</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Sequence Types: </span><span class = "text">list, tuple, range</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Mapping Type: </span><span class = "text">dict</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Set Types: </span><span class = "text">set, frozenset</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Boolean Type: </span><span class = "text">bool</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">Binary Types: </span><span class = "text">bytes, bytearray, memoryview</span></p>
                <p><span class = "type">None Type: </span><span class = "text">Nonetype</span></p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Numbers">
            <h1>Python Numbers</h1>
            <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class = "text">int</span></li>
              <li><span class = "text">float</span></li>
              <li><span class = "text">complex</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
            <code>x = 1 <span class = "comment"># int</span><br>y = 2.8 <span class = "comment"># float</span><br>z = 1j <span class = "comment"># complex</span></code>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Python_Strings">
          <h2>Strings</h2>
          <p>Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.</p>
          <p>You can display a string literal with the <span class = "text">print()</span> function:</p>
          <code>x = "Hello"<br>print(x)</code>
